                  I first started playing drums when I was 6 years old and played it till I was 12. Due to
                  some personal troubles I dropped it and only started to get back into music when I picked up an old
                  guitar we had laying around when I was 17. I am now playing guitar regularly for my self. It helps
                  calming me and also to rebuild my mental energy.
